## Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

**The company wants to know:**
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands.
  
**Objective:**
Build a **Linear Regression model** for the demand of shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.

## The Approach
1) Reading and Understanding the Data
2) Data manipulation and cleaning
3) Visualising the Data
4) Data Preparation
5) Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
6) Building model
7) Residual Analysis of the train data
8) Making Predictions Using the Final Model
9) Model Evaluation
